# COVID-19-Challenge

The UC Davis COVID-19 Challenge brought together M.S. in Business Analytics and MBA students with a single goal in mindâ€”harness the power of data to develop creative insights for policymakers to battle the coronavirus outbreak.

The two-week online data hack encouraged students to put their collective knowledge and skills to work to address widespread socioeconomic problems caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

Sheltered-in-place since mid-March, more than 60 students on 14 teams rallied via Zoom and FaceTime during the challenge, digging deep into datasets from multiple public health and tracking sources to develop quick solutions.

<b>The goal of our project was to assess the role of partisanship in the battle with COVID-19.</b>

Through our findings, we recommended a state-led response utilizing data from three different angles: public awareness, government intervention and community mobility reports.
